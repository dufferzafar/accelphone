\chapter{Literature Review}

% The exploitation of zero-permission sensors of smartphones, resulting in secu- rity and privacy breaches, has been investigated in many previous publications [1, 10, 11, 5, 18, 15, 4, 3, 2, 12, 8, 9]. These attacks include behavioral profiling, geo lo- calisation, and PIN recovery. The first two applications rely on the relative ease to detect significant movements of the user and the smartphone.
