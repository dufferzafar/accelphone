\section{Sensor Tile Kit}

% TODO: Add android code screenshot that shows the limitation
In section \ref{ch1-intro-android}, we explained how Android limits the sensor data sampling rate to around 200Hz, which is good enough for monitoring device movements, such as tilt, rotation etc.
% TODO: Fix this line
but is low for our goal to use it as an microphone since human audible frequencies lie in the 20Hz to 20kHz range.
To explore what could be done if we had access to high frequency sensor data, we tried a specialized sensor board - the SensorTile by STMicroelectronics.

The SensorTile is a tiny, square-shaped IoT module that packs powerful processing capabilities leveraging an 80 MHz microcontroller, a Bluetooth low energy connectivity based on BlueNRG-MS network processor as well as a wide spectrum of motion, such as a triaxial accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and environmental sensors, such as pressure, humidity and temperature and even a digital microphone. \cite{stkit}

Figure \ref{fig:sensortilekit} shows the contents of the SensorTile kit.

Figure \ref{fig:sensortile} shows position of main components of the SensorTile board, and Table \ref{table:sensortile} lists their description. \cite{stkitmanual}

% By default, the SensorTile comes loaded
The LSM6DSM sensor on the SensorTile board is the accelerometer and is capable of capturing data at a maximum rate of.

To interface with the sensor hardware, there are three available firmwares for the board:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item DataLogger
    \item AudioLog
    \item ALLMEMS
\end{enumerate}

Our goals with the SensorTile were two fold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Gather data at the maximum rate possible.
\item Record both motion sensors and microphone at the same time (so that we could )
\end{enumerate}

We were unable to get either of these tasks working.

The firmware is recent, and the documentation is very scarce.
